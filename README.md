# Deep-Researcher-Ai

An AI-powered, multi-agent research assistant in Python that performs iterative, depth-oriented exploration of a topic—handling planning, searching, writing, and email summarization.

##  Overview

**Deep-Researcher-Ai** orchestrates several specialized agents to conduct deep research:

- **Planner Agent** (`planner_agent.py`): Develops a coherent research strategy or breakdown.
- **Search Agent** (`search_agent.py`): Executes web searches and collects relevant data.
- **Writer Agent** (`writer_agent.py`): Synthesizes findings into well-structured narrative or report.
- **Email Agent** (`email_agent.py`): Delivers the final summary to your inbox via SMTP or any configured email service.
- **Research Manager** (`research_manager.py`): Coordinates the entire flow, from planning to delivery.
- **Main Entry** (`deep_research.py`): Ties everything together—defines the topic, parameters, and runs the full research pipeline.

##  Features

- Modular, agent-based design for flexible development and testing.
- Customizable research depth and topic specificity.
- Automated summarization and seamless report delivery via email.
